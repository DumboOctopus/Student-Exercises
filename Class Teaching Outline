Classes Teaching Order thing. For new students, for old students just kinda figure it out as it goes

Teach usage before creation:
    BigInteger Problems

Teach how to draw them:
    [ref] ----> Object

Teach several simple examples (no constructors, no visibility):
    Person:
        +age
        +name
        +toString()
    Student:
        +grade
        +age
        +name
        +toString()
    Classroom:
        has-2 Students
        +getOlderStudent()
        +getYoungerStudent()
        +toString()
    Number (but simple version)
        +value
        +add(int other)
        +subtract(int other)
        +toString()
    
REMEMBER:
    MAKE THEM USE the classes they make. 
    Incrementally develop them. 
    Make them draw out the program as it executes
    TRACE THE CODE. REMMEBER TRACE THE CODE ITS VERY IMPORTANT
    create them together in class, then have them try to create them on their own. 
    
//==========now here the untested part==============//

Utility class:
    MathUtilityClass class
    StudentUtilityClass
    ClassroomUtilityClass
    NumberUtilityClass

Explain java's Math class

REMEMBER:
    Compare and contrast concrete and utility classes
    make sure they understand static by intuition first, not by definition. 
    
---back to concrete classes:

Visibilty:
    public and private
    make getters and setters
   
Constructors:
    Make constructors

--lets make big games and stuff :D
Basic Slang words quiz (or SAT words):
    Word class:
        +word
        +definition
    Main class
        +main(String[] args)
